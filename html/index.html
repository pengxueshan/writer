                        <p>In the previous article we took a look at Elm and how we can structure Elm applications. It is important to divide logic into different files and allow views to share state and trigger any actions to change the state in the application. This is based on ideas from Flux, which allows us to structure and scale applications without causing a lot of pain.</p>

                <p>Got into programming about 5 years ago and completely fell in love with it. The productivity you have working with the web platform is incredible. Going from idea to production can be done in a matter of hours. The momentum of new standards, new practices, ideas and solutions also keeps me on my toes, as there is always something new to dive into. The greatest thing about the web as a platform though is its open source community. Love contributing with ideas and thoughts on current and new developments in the world of web applications.</p>
